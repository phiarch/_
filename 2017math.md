Competition entry for [A House for Maryam Mirzakhani](https://www.callforproject.com/contests/a-house-for-maryam-mirzakhani-1563) The work includes two designs, both worked on by the team.

This ‘house’, is in fact, a live-in work studio, a class room, a research lab and a conference room for the study and teaching of geometry and math. In addition to doing math and geometry on the floor, cooking, sleeping and eating activities will all take place on the floor. The elimination of all furniture facilitates the changing uses.

This studio ‘greenhouse’ is intended for a family of four, mother and father (both mathematicians) and two children. The ‘house’ is primarily a work studio for the mother, who teaches math and geometry to her own children, as well as to guest children.
