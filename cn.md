The Carbon Natural Project started when I first arrived in Wenzhou. I was inspired by the common things that surrounded me. I tried to use common things to make novel structural forms. The intention with this project is to find place in between two extremes found within the building industry: mass customized spaceframes, and mass produced uncustomized spaceframes.

The project attempted to do much of the early testing as a childrens toy, and has moved into full scale site specific and gallery installations throughout the world.

##### The project has had many successes including:
