Recollections - Pressing Forward, Through Remembering

In today's fast paced globalizing world, it is easy to forget what has come before. China, is in a particular place of progression and growth. With that growth comes growing pains and losses. By remembering, we are able to mitigate and eleviate some of the challenging effects of growth. This exhibition, seeks to remember while looking forward toward future progress.

The exhibition features work from the Aga Khan, which as an organization, is focused on preserving cultural heratige. Other contributions consider Wenzhou as a place, particularly in regards to what is left of representations of culture from a prior time, while making progress toward a bright future aided through technologies.
